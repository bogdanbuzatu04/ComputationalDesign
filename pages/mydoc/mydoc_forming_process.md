## Facade moving bricks
The inspiration for our facade came from the gallery of cloaked bricks in Israel. This is a very interesting facade with bricks connected in the middle by metal rods. These bricks can move and can be changed for example throughout the day. This gives a very interesting look. 
We opted for bricks because the city of The Hague is characterized by brick buildings, for example 'het Binnenhof'.  We wanted to make a connection between the existing architecture but also give it a modern twist, which fits the more modern way of working we took on with houdini.
