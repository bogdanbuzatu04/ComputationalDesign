# Process of massing
In Forming we established different criteria we find important to implement in our project. This is a recap of the matters we wanted to take into account. 

- Sun casting
- Shadow casting
- Keeping bike path clear
- Agent-based function placement using distance optimization per function
- Comfortable housing
- Giving natural light 
- Combined living
- Seperation public and private
- Adding available facilities 

In Massing these criteria will be implemented with different methodologies. For placing the interior functions we used agent-based modelling. These are the codes we used for our building:
- Voxelization
- Cutting out bikepath and garden
- Cutting the envelope
- Calculating the distances
- Shadow casting
- Daylight analysis
