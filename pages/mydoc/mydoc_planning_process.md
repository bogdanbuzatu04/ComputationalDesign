# Context analysis
## Location analysis
First we started with making an analysis of the location. Extra attention was given to nearby facilities for ederly. When a function was not within a reasonable walking distance (800 metres), it was included in our design. In the maps below, the position of the building in the city of The Hague is shown. This is divided in maps on a large scale (1:20.000), medium scale (1:5.000) and a small scale (1:3000).

*Map of the location in the city of The Hague on a medium scale (1:5.000)*

As you can see on the pictures on a larger scale, the building is situated in the city of The Hague, a densly built area. There is not a lot of surrounding greenery, but there is water nearby. In front there is a busy road, which is likely to create a lot of sound, which is something that can be taken into account. Also there are a lot of surrounding building that need to be considered, for example when looking at the shadow casting.

As is visible in the location picture on the small scale, there is a park nearby but the street in front of the facade does not have a lot of green, yet. This is something that can be taken into account. Which brings us to our design principles.


## Design Goals
### Interior
The goal for this building is to create a nice living environment for students, starters and elderly. The facilities in the building must be an attribute to the residents but also to the neighboorhoud. The building must have the following characteristics:

- Comfortable housing
- Giving natural light 
- Combined living
- Seperation public and private
- Adding available facilities 

Since the residents are in different fases of their lives, they will need different facilities. We also want to connect the different needs to emphasize the combined living aspect. At the same time, we also take into account the parts of these different groups that do not match. This is why in other parts of the building, these groups are seperated. 

### Exterior
The building must nicely fit in the neighboorhoud and also take the surrounding buildings into account. This is why the following analysis will be excecuted:
- Sun casting
- Shadow casting
- Keeping bike path clear
- Agent-based function placement using distance optimization per function

Other elements that will be looked at:
- Making facilities accessible by placing the on the ground floor
- Minimizing sound 
- Interesting design
- Adding greenery
